# Mazine

[English](readme.md) ¬∑ [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](/MDs/Mazine_zh.md)

Mazine is a **Serverless modern image hosting application** built on **Next.js 14** and object storage services, with the following features:

- **No database management**: No longer worry about database failures causing image hosting to go down.
- **Code Hosting**: The project code is hosted on **GitHub** and deployed to **Vercel**.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Passwords and related environment variables must be manually added to Vercel to ensure the security of sensitive information.

### CDN Security and Recommended Configuration

Due to the high risk of password leaks when handling CDN through open-source code, this project does not include any CDN conversion code. It is recommended to manage the CDN using the following methods:

1. **R2 Custom Subdomain**: Secure access by configuring a dedicated R2 subdomain.
2. **Cloudflare Worker**: Use Cloudflare Worker for efficient CDN acceleration and processing.
3. **Alist S3 CDN Functionality**: Leverage Alist integration for easy CDN implementation.
